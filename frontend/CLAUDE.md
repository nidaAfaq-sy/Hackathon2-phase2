## 🎯 Frontend Focus
Next.js application with Better Auth and JWT authentication

## ⚠️ CRITICAL RULES
1. **Specs control code. Code never leads specs.**
2. All implementation must reference spec files using `@specs/` syntax
3. JWT tokens must be attached to Authorization header for API calls
4. Better Auth must be configured with JWT plugin
5. UI must follow responsive design principles

## ✅ Implementation Checklist
- [ ] Better Auth setup with JWT plugin
- [ ] API client with JWT token attachment
- [ ] Task list component
- [ ] Task form (create/edit)
- [ ] Task CRUD operations
- [ ] Responsive layout with Tailwind
